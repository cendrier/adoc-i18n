# Proof of Concept for Asciidoctor's translation

## Source

All this experiments comes from the following page:
link:https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-doc/tree/master/doc_alternatives#internationalization[]

## Requirements

* GNU `make`
* Docker, then we can provide an image with:
** Asciidoctor
** po4a (https://po4a.alioth.debian.org/download.php)

NOTE: We use Alpine Linux as base OS, but Debian has also been
validated as alternative

* With those requirements ready,
execute the following command line to build the environment:
+
[source,bash]
----
make build-docker
----

## Workflow

The idea is to have the following simplified generation "workflow".
Example are given with a "French" translation (`$LANGUAGE=fr`).

. _(Execute once for all)_ Extract translatable strings
** Input file: `index.adoc`
** Resulting file: `po/index.pot`
** Example:
+
[source,bash]
----
make init-translation-template
ls -l ./samples/po/index.pot
----

. Generate a ".po" translation file for language `${LANGUAGE}`
.. _(Execute once per translation)_ Initialize a translation
for language `${LANGUAGE}`
** Input file: `po/index.pot`
** Resulting file: `po/${LANGUAGE}.po`
** Example:
+
[source,bash]
----
LANGUAGE=fr make init-translation
ls -l ./samples/po/fr*
----

.. **OR** _(Execute once per update of original document)_
Update the translation file
** Input file: `index.adoc`
** Resulting file: `po/${LANGUAGE}.po`
** Example:
+
[source,bash]
----
LANGUAGE=fr make update-translation
ls -l ./samples/po/fr*
----

. _(Execute on each update or translation's creation)_
Translate strings in the ".po" file
** Input file: `po/${LANGUAGE}.po`
** Resulting file: `po/${LANGUAGE}.po`
+
[source,bash]
----
vim ./samples/po/fr.po
ls -l ./samples/po/fr*
----

. _(Execute on each update or translation's creation)_
Generated translated asciidoctor
** Input files: `po/${LANGUAGE}.po` and `index.adoc`
** Resulting file: `index_$(LANGUAGE).adoc`
+
[source,bash]
----
LANGUAGE=fr make translate
ls -l ./samples/index*fr*.adoc
----

. _(Execute on each update or translation's creation)_
Generate HTML from asciidoctor
** Input file: `index_$(LANGUAGE).adoc`
** Resulting file: `index_$(LANGUAGE).html`
** Example:
+
[source,bash]
----
LANGUAGE=fr make build-doc
ls -l ./samples/index*fr*.html
----

## UTF-8 support

* I've validated against French special chars: it is OK
* Is it working with non Roman languages? I don't know and need help on this.

## Bullets

* I had a hard time differenciating Asciidocotr's bullets from
"bold font for emphazis"

* **TL;DR;** use newlines around bullets (or sub-bullets)
to make the "block" explicit

## Images

* Images "string" are seen as translatable string. This is is very **powerful**
** We can provide localized images!
** Need to test this with videos as well
* A good strategy is to have a common image directory
(`:imagesdir:` attribute in asciidoctor) for generic images (such as icons)
** And use the language code in the image strings to have it translated,
as `image::fr/build.jpg[]`
** The fallback is the original provided string for image location: so the
original documents (and its images) is not required to be in English by default.


## Updating translations

* The command `make update-translation` is based upon the command
`po4a-updaterepo`
* It is pretty impressive to keep track of changes
* It always create a local backup of the previous version:
If you original file was `po/fr.po`, then you will have a `po/fr.po~` file.
** Easy to diff, however `po` seems to have a syntax on the comment to search
for changed strings
** Only a single backup can exists. If you run again the update command, then
the previous backup file is overwritten: _no history_.

## Testing / Validating

* A process should always be run when building documents to monitor some
translation elements as:
** Strings not translated
** String translated but not updated after a document update
** Syntax and custom pattern issues like "Bullets not separated by blank lines"
